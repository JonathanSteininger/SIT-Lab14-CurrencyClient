This is a CLI application that queries a local server for conversion rates from and to NZD.

The user needs to enter two perameters to query the server. 1) a letter ("b" or "s") to select the buy or sell conversion. 2) the conversion currency. eg: "aud" (Australian dollar).

and example for a promt is "b aud" for the buy conversion to australian dollars.
